# Chatbot-with-SpeechToText-and-GUI
A simple chatbot trained using Tensorflow. The GUI is created using Tkinter. It has SpeechToText utilizing pyqtts and TextToSpeech using Google Cloud SPeech Recognition services.
I tried using DeepSpeech models but it was too inaccurate, pretty hard to beat Google at this.

For the GUI, I first tried using PySimpleGUI but that didn't end well. It's great, but I found Tkinter easier for me. I don't know what you'll like. Definitely try them both as an extra challenge.
I am a Twitter Developer so I use their API Tweepy. Yes, I definitely tried using other options that don't require API keys or something but none worked for me. Even after a multitude of tutorials and looking through documentation. It seems most of them keep breaking down.

I created my own intents. Customizing your own is as easy as using your own intents.
